# Example project

Projects represent individual or team mastery artifacts. On the completion of a project it is displayed in the project gallery where a mentors and peers can provide feedback. Upon completion of the course, the learner's projects serve as a mastery portfolio.


## Objectives

- Create a website using core web programming technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Deploy the website to a public URL.

## Deliverable

Build a website that represents the core technologies presented in this course.
 
## Instructions

1. Design the website
2. Create the website
3. Deploy the website

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary<br/>(4 points) | Proficient<br/>(3 points) | Developing<br/>(2 points) | Needs Improvement<br/>(1 point) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | Components are well-defined, follow a clear naming convention, and are highly reusable. Common UI elements are abstracted into dedicated components. Minimal prop drilling. | Components are generally well-defined and reusable. Most common UI elements are components. Some prop drilling might be present. | Components are present but may lack clear definition or reusability. Significant duplication of UI elements. Extensive prop drilling. | Components are poorly defined, not reusable, or are absent. Excessive duplication and reliance on direct DOM manipulation. |
| **State** | State is managed effectively and efficiently using appropriate React hooks (useState, useContext, useReducer) or a dedicated state management library (Redux, Zustand). State logic is clear and separated. | State is managed using standard React hooks. State logic is mostly clear but could be more optimized or organized. | State management is inconsistent or uses less efficient patterns. State logic can be difficult to follow. | State is managed poorly, leading to bugs, performance issues, or is not managed at all. |
| **Routing** | Implemented using React Router with well-defined routes, nested routing where appropriate, and protected routes for sensitive areas. Clear navigation structure. | Basic routing is implemented using React Router. Routes are generally functional but might lack advanced features like nested or protected routes. | Routing is implemented but may be basic, difficult to navigate, or have issues with route handling. | Routing is missing, broken, or implemented in a way that hinders user experience. |
| **Responsiveness** | Styling is implemented using a consistent approach (CSS Modules, styled-components, Tailwind CSS) and is fully responsive across various devices. Clean and well-organized CSS. | Styling is implemented with a consistent approach and is mostly responsive. Minor issues with responsiveness might exist. | Styling is applied but may be inconsistent or have significant responsiveness issues. CSS is disorganized. | Styling is absent, broken, or hinders usability. No consideration for responsiveness. |
| **Performance** | Demonstrates understanding of performance best practices (e.g., `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, code splitting, lazy loading). Application loads quickly and is smooth. | Some performance optimizations are implemented, but opportunities for further improvement exist. Application is generally performant. | Minimal or no performance optimizations are evident. Application may exhibit noticeable lag or slow loading times. | Significant performance issues are present, making the application difficult to use. |
| **Errors** | Robust error handling is implemented using mechanisms like Error Boundaries. User-friendly error messages are displayed. | Basic error handling is present, but might not cover all scenarios or provide the best user experience. | Error handling is minimal or absent, leading to broken UI or unhelpful messages. | No error handling is implemented, resulting in crashes or a poor user experience. |
| **Quality** | Code is well-formatted, follows established React best practices, and includes meaningful comments where necessary. Variable and function names are descriptive. | Code is generally well-formatted and readable. Minor deviations from best practices might occur. | Code formatting is inconsistent, and readability is challenging. Variable/function names may be unclear. | Code is poorly formatted, difficult to understand, and lacks adherence to any standard. |
| **Accessibility** | Implements semantic HTML, ARIA attributes where appropriate, and keyboard navigation. Content is accessible to users with disabilities. | Basic accessibility considerations are made, but some areas may be lacking. | Limited or no attention paid to accessibility. | The website is not accessible to users with disabilities. |
